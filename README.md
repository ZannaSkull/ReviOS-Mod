ReviOS Mod is a customized version of Windows, designed to be lightweight, stable, and focused on improving performance, privacy and compatibility. It aspires to re-create what Windows as an operating system should have been - easy and simple. Now compatible with [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io).

# What are "mod" changes? 
Basically nothing installations give 2 different browsers that I like more.
Future changes will be written and added
